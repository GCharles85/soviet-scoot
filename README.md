Larry Showers is a U-3 pilot for the Air Force, who flies regular missions over the Soviet Union. Shortly after the disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, the U.S. Government wanted a closer look; to see what the Soviets were still hiding. Larry was sent in his U-3 to investigate, flying high overhead while he took pictures from his plane. Unfortunately for Larry, he is shot down by a Soviet Surface-To-Air missle, knocking him out of the sky. Luckily, Larry is able to eject, and parachutes down into Chernobyl, donning his gas mask to complement his rad gear. Initially fearing for his life, Larry soon remembers his hip pack, part of which he'd packed with his trusty scooter (model SC-007). Knowing what he has to do, Larry unfolds it, hops on, and starts kicking. He knows he won't be stopping for a long time. (He plans to head for the border)
